-- Project completed for Khan Academy's Intro to SQL Course. In this project I created a table for grades in a gradebook and proceeded to use aggregate functions with case statements to create more complex queries.

CREATE TABLE student_grades (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    number_grade INTEGER,
    fraction_completed REAL);
    
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winston", 90, 0.805);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winnefer", 95, 0.901);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winsteen", 85, 0.906);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Wincifer", 66, 0.7054);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winster", 76, 0.5013);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed)
    VALUES ("Winstonia", 82, 0.9045);

-- Select students along with their grades and a column measuring the percent of the course they have completed. 
SELECT name, number_grade, ROUND(fraction_completed * 100) AS percent_completed FROM student_grades;

-- Count how many students have grades that fall into each letter grade category.
SELECT COUNT(*),
    CASE
        WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN "A"
        WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN "B"
        WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN "C"
        ELSE "F"
    END AS letter_grade
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY letter_grade;
