# Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!

This code repository is especially designated to contain all examples of SQL code I've writen for various projects and assignments. It will be a broad repository to showcase all manner of examples ranging from queries with aggregate functions, joins, nested subqueries, and other miscellaneous keyword usage like conditional CASE statements, etc.

Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions:
